In computer science, sequences of characters are referred to as strings. Strings can be any length and can include any character such as:
 
- Letters
- Numbers
- Symbols
- Whitespace (spaces, tabs, new lines)

It is usually contained within a pair of `'single quotes'` or `"double quotes"`.

A string can be thought of as a list of characters. Like any other list, each character in a string has an index.

## Example

Here are some examples of strings:

```py
message = "Hello, world!"
username = "@sonnynomnom"
old_password = "Tr0ub4dor&3"
new_password = "correcthorsebatterystaple"
```
