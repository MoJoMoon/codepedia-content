An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is software that enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program within a single application. These actions include editing source code, building executables, and debugging.

## Notable Examples

There are numerous IDEs available, such as:

- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)

The IDE you decide to use depends on what area of computer programming you wish to pursue. Some IDEs, like Android Studio and XCode, are dedicated solely for building mobile applications.
