An argument is the actual value of a variable (aka. the parameter) passed into a function.

## Example

Suppose we have a function called `tripleThis()`:

```js
function tripleThis(x) {
   return x * 3 
}

tripleThis(6)
```

The parameter is `x` since it is the variable. The argument is `6` since it is the actual value.
