## Int

`int` is a type for storing integer (whole) numbers. An integer typically requires 4 bytes of memory space and ranges from -2³¹ to 2³¹.

```cpp
int year = 1991;
int age = 28;
```

## Double

`double` is a type for storing floating point (decimal) numbers. Double variables typically require 8 bytes of memory space.

```cpp
double price = 8.99;
double pi = 3.14159;
```

## Bool

`bool` is a type for storing true or false boolean values. Booleans typically require 1 byte of memory space.

```cpp
bool organ_donor = true;
bool late_to_work = false;
```

## Char

`char` is a type for storing individual characters. Characters are wrapped in single quotes '. Characters typically require 1 byte of memory space and range from -128 to 127.

```cpp
char grade = 'A';
char punctuation = '?';
```

## String

`std::string` is a type for storing text strings. Strings are wrapped in double quotes `"`.

```cpp
std::string message = "good nite";
std::string user = "@sonnynomnom";
