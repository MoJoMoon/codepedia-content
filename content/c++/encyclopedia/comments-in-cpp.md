A comment is a piece of text within a program that is not executed. It can be used to provide additional information to aid in understanding the code.

## Single-line Comments

Single-line comments are created using two consecutive forward slashes. The compiler ignores any text after `//` on the same line.

```cpp
// This line will denote a comment in C++
```

## Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments are created using `/*` to begin the comment, and `*/` to end the comment. The compiler ignores any text in between.

```cpp
/* 
This is all commented out.
None of it is going to run!
*/
```
