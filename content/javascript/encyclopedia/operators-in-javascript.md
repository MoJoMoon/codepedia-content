## Assignment Operator

The assignment operator (`=`) assigns a value to a variable.

```js
var x = 10;
```

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

* `+` addition
* `-` subtraction
* `*` multiplication
* `/` division
* `%` modulo

```js
// Addition
5 + 5
// Subtraction
10 - 5
// Multiplication
5 * 10
// Division
10 / 5
// Modulo
10 % 5
```

## Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. Here are some of them:

* `+=` addition assignment
* `-=` subtraction assignment
* `*=` multiplication assignment
* `/=` division assignment

```js
let number = 100;
 
// Both statements will add 10
number = number + 10;
number += 10;
 
console.log(number); 
// Prints: 120
```

## Comparison Operators

- `==` equal to
- `===`	equal value and equal type
- `!=` not equal
- `!==` not equal value or not equal type
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `?`ternary operator
