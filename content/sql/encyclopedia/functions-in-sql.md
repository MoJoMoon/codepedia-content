There are two types of SQL functions, aggregate functions, and scalar (non-aggregate) functions. Aggregate functions operate on many records and produce a summary, works with `GROUP BY` whereas non-aggregate functions operate on each record independently.

## Aggregate Functions

This function can produce a single value for an entire group or table. They operate on sets of rows and return results based on groups of rows.

Some aggregate functions are:

* `COUNT()` function
* `AVG()` function
* `MIN()` function
* `MAX()` function
* `SUM()` function

## Arithmetic Functions

A mathematical function executes a mathematical operation usually based on input values that are provided as arguments, and return a numeric value as the result of the operation. Mathematical functions operate on numeric data such as `DECIMAL`, `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, `REAL`, `SMALLINT`, and `TINYINT`.

Some arithmetic functions are:

- `ABS()`
- `CEIL()`
- `FLOOR()`
- `EXP()`
- `LN()`
- `MOD()`
- `POWER()`
- `SQRT()`

## Character Functions

A character or string function is a function which takes one or more characters or numbers as parameters and returns a character value. Basic string functions offer a number of capabilities and return a string value as a result set.

Some Character functions are:

- `LOWER()`
- `UPPER()`
- `TRIM()`
- `TRANSLATE()`
