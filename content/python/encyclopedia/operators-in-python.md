Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the `+` operator to add together two values:

```py
print(10 + 5)
```

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

| Operator	| Name	| Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `+` | Addition | `a + b` |	
| `-` | Subtraction | `a - b` |	
| `*` |	Multiplication | `x * y` |	
| `/` |	Division | `x / y` |
| `%` |	Modulus	| `x % y` |	
| `**` | Exponentiation	| `x ** y` |	
| `//` | Floor division | `x // y` |

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

- `+=`
- `-=`	
- `*=`	
- `/=`	
- `%=`

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

| Operator	| Name	| Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `==` | Equal | `a == b` |
| `!=` | Not equal | `a != b` |	
| `<` | Less than | `a < b` |	
| `>` | Greater than | `a > b` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `a <= b` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to |	`a >= b` |

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

| Operator	| Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `and` | Returns True if both statements are true | `x < 5 and x < 10` |	
| `or` | Returns True if one of the statements is true | `x < 5` or `x < 4` |
| `not`	| Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true |	`not(x < 10)` |
